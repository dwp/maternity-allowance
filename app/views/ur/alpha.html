        <li>Agents didn&rsquo;t notice the Key Details bar.</li>
        <li>Date claim received didn&rsquo;t cause any issues, but it was highlighted that it&rsquo;s very unlikely that agents would be working on claims from today or yesterday, so they would always need to enter a different date.</li>

        <li>To further our understanding of the MAP rules and the information agents require for cases which fall into each rule group, we created 2 scenarios for testing in this round of research.</li>
        <li>Scenario 1 â€“ The claimant&rsquo;s baby has been born between the 11th and 4th week. The claimant&rsquo;s chosen MAP start date is too far in the future. The MAP starts the day after the baby is born.</li>

          <li>We have moved the Allowed tag to sit next to the Decision as it was not providing value in the claimant details banner.</li>

        <li>The iterated navigation worked well in this first round of research. The navigation bar wasn&rsquo;t noticed by all, but those who did used it quickly upon seeing the page. Those who didn&rsquo;t were able to scroll through the content without any problems. There was no prompting required to find other information as with the tabs previously.</li>
        <li>The white details bar reassured agents that they were looking at the right record and they were referencing the details here when asked this question.</li>
        <li>Employer name was highlighted again as a piece of information that is missing that they would need.</li>
        <li>There was some uncertainty around the highest earning weeks. In previous rounds we&rsquo;ve heard people state that they must be the highest, but during this round there were some doubts as to whether these were the highest the claimant provided and whether there could potentially be any higher ones we&rsquo;re unaware of.</li>
        <li>In terms of where the information was from and the trust they would have in it, there wasn&rsquo;t as much recognition that this information was from trusted sources. Agents presumed it was from the MA1, and their trust was based on how much they would trust that particular MA1 rather than the information presented.</li>
