                <li>In this round of UR we wanted to start exploring non happy path scenarios which agents may encounter with the new service i.e. Partial RTI data and an RTI error.</li>
                <li>Scenario 1 enables an agent to start processing a claim, however, there is only 10 weeks of employment and earnings information available from RTI.</li>
                <li>This could be due to the claimant only having a short spell of employment, or being employed by another employer who does not declare their payroll to HMRC. This applies to some small employers.</li>
                <li>As a result of the 10 weeks information, the system cannot assess the employment and earnings tests, and cannot make a decision whether to award the claim. This also prevents the determination of the MAP start and end dates, which we could work out, but should not be displayed without a decision.</li>
                <li>We chose to use the Pending tag to reflect the status of the case, we show a Claim created date, we removed any line in the table where we do not have a response to display.</li>
                <li>As we cannot confidently assess the employment and earnings tests we provided details that only 10 weeks of data was provided by RTI.</li>
                <li>In the table of highest earning weeks it was not obvious that only 10 weeks were listed, so we expanded the table heading to state this.</li>
                <li>Scenario 2 explores agent response when there is an error with the RTI API.</li>
                <li>The dates gather questions did not test well in the last round of testing, but we decided not to change them yet as we had mixed results in the sessions, and there was not a consistent way of interacting with them.</li>
                <li>We have started with the There is a problem with the service pages pattern, which is in an Experimental state in the Design System. We will use this to explore what agents need in a service-error situation, and what they understand about what might have happened. This insight will help to inform further iterations.</li>

              <li>We believe agents will understand that the 10 weeks of employment and earnings could be supplemented by further information from the claimant. We hope to understand what they would expect to do next to move the case into a Decision state.</li>

              <li>As we move into the Private Beta phase we have reorganised the prototype to group iterations tested in Alpha phase together. Private Beta iterations will sit in a new folder.</li>
              <li>At the start of the journey we have created a simple landing page from which the agent will choose the type of activity they need to complete: Start a claim or Find a claim.</li>
              <li>We were unable to find any established patterns from other agent-facing services, so have created something new.</li>
              <li>We considered radio buttons but felt this created additional effort for the user. We also considered plain links on the page but this looked aesthetically odd. We have used Gov Blue and created a large target area for each option which we believe will be easy for agents to use as they progress through their workload.</li>
              <li>We also considered having a default state for agents such as Start a claim, and an option for agents to move from that default state to Find a claim if they needed to, but this felt complicated, and there is no clear indication of what a default selection should be.</li>
              <li>The data gather questions have been changed from conditional reveals to radio questions with date input on a following page. This removes Accessibility concerns raised around the conditional reveal.</li>
              <li>We have changed the format of the pages to have a short H1 and a following question - we hope that this will help users to enter the correct dates on each page.</li>
              <li>On the Summary we have changed our tags to be blue and lowercase to see if this aids readability and removes any potential bias or assumptions related to the colour of tags.</li>
              <li>We have added the name of the employer as we can gather this from RTI. We have used the name registered with Companies House as this is what HMRC can provide to us.</li>
              <li>As we have built a good level of trust among agents and a longer period of time has lapsed since we last tested with them, we want to explore whether we can remove some information from the Summary page and maintain that agent trust and confidence. The first thing we have decided to remove is the dates used for the Employment and Earnings tests.</li>
              <li>Research has shown that agents expect to find a claim using the claimant&rsquo;s National Insurance Number so we have used that for the Find a claim search.</li>
              <li>At this time we have not included anything for a security check, as agents have indicated there may be enough information on the summary page to confirm the claimant&rsquo;s identity through standard questions. We may need to amend this if additional ID&V requirements are exposed.</li>

            <li>NOTE: For scenarios where the Employment test is NOT met, we believe we will need to provide additional information such as the number of weeks they were employed, by whom, and when.</li>
