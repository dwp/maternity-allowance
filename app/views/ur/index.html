              <li>When on separate pages, it allows users to digest the content easier, but this is for quick, speedy, input and doesn&rsquo;t need to be digested as it&rsquo;ll be used many times per day.</li>

            <li>There were no issues with the data capture.</li>
            <li>There was an expectation that this information would be saved if they needed to leave the claim or BF it at any point.</li>

            <li>Agents did not understand where the information on the summary page had come from to form the decision.</li>
            <li>However, it did seem like there was a greater level of trust in this information than there was during the previous scenario-based research.</li>
            <li>The MAP was something agents expected to see as part of this decision, or as the next step in the process.</li>

          <li>As with the previous round, agents weren’t sure where this information was from, there was slightly less recognition that it could be form a source such as RTI.</li>
          <li>The highest earning weeks was noticed by some agents without the need for prompting. The information contained was reassuring to agents as it is similar to how the information is entered and displayed in legacy. This was described as being useful if someone was entitled to a variable rate so that the wages used could be checked.</li>
