          <li>The highest earning weeks was noticed by some agents without the need for prompting.

          <li>We used radio options for Today, Yesterday, and Another date as we believe most claims would be processed within 2 days of receipt.</li>

        <li>The introduction of the MAP did also seem to create a need to know the 14th and 20th weeks for eligibility purposes.</li>
        <li>Agents didn&rsquo;t notice the Key Details bar.</li>
        <li>Date claim received didn&rsquo;t cause any issues, but it was highlighted that it&rsquo;s very unlikely that agents would be working on claims from today or yesterday, so they would always need to enter a different date.</li>
        <li>Employer name was highlighted as being needed. This has been heard in previous rounds of research. Currently this cannot be pulled through by the Finances team.</li>

          <li>We added a question to find out if the claimant has chosen a date when they would like their MA payments to start. Not every claimant provides this answer, so we needed a way to make it optional. If they have provided a preferred start date, the agent will be able to input it in the conditional reveal.</li>
